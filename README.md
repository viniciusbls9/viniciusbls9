Nice to meet you, I'm a front-end developer focused on the JavaScript stack (ReactJS, React Native, NodeJS and more). I am passionate about technology, and I have big dreams to learn more each day.

I have been a programmer for 3 years now and today, working as a Front-end developer, I prioritize clean code, performance, and usability in the large applications I work with.

Front-end experiences
- Clean code
- VanillaJS
- React
- Typescript
- API's integrations
- Responsive Layout
- Usability
- SEO
- GIT versioning code (CI/CD).

Front-end learn

- Best Design Patterns
- Best software development practices

Back-end learn
- Clean code

Outside of my working hours, I try to enrich my knowledge in programming and other subjects, such as digital marketing and entrepreneurship.
